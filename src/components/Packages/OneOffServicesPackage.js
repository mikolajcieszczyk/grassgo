                        <p>If a regular maintenance service is not what youâ€™re looking for, then we can also offer you a one-off service suited to your requirements. This could be anything from hedge trimming, to treatment of Japanese knotweed or a large scale clear out. Large scale clear outs can help reign in your wild garden, getting it into a manageable state for a more regular maintenance program.</p>
